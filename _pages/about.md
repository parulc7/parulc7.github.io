Hi, my name is Parul Chandel. I graduated with Computer Science Major from NIT Durgapur. I work mainly with MERN Stack, with working experience in Django, Vue.js and GoLang. Computer Science has intrigued me ever since I was a child, and I love to learn something new about it everyday. I love solving Problems - building simple and efficient solutions to complex problems.

> Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another. Don’t hope for a life without problems. There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.

Other than that, I love to read, listen to music, watch movies, and travel.
